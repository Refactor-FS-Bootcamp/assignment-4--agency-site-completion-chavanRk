    <h1>About Our Hospital</h1>
    <p style="padding: 20px;">Sanjeevani Hospital is a tertiary care hospital in Hadapsar that was formed due to the tireless efforts of 
        Dr. Dileep Mane and his team. For creating a facility of this scale and magnitude, he faced several challenges 
        initially that included finding suitable land, getting the necessary finance, and recruiting competent staff. 
        But as they believed- when intentions are good, challenges don’t stand a chance. The hospital was inaugurated on 7th July 2007. 
        With 250 beds it is South East Pune’s 1st NABH Accredited Hospital, it is also the youngest Green OT Hospital offering an
